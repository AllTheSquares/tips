    <h3 class ="about-site" align:center>Hosting your own website on GitHub</h3>
    
    <ol class = "about-site">
        <li>Begin by creating a new repository. Name it as followed: <strong>"username".github.io</strong> (Replace "username" with your GitHub username, you can see this in the web address of this page.</li>
        <li><strong>I recommend that you download GitHub Desktop at this point.</strong> It makes editing your site easier than having to publish changes via a terminal. Once downloaded, <em>clone your repository via this app. </em>
            <li>Cloning a repository creates a folder on your computer. On your favorite code editor of choice (I recommend either <a href = https://code.visualstudio.com/>Visual Studio Code</a> or <a href = https://www.sublimetext.com/>Sublime Text</a>, which may need a license to use), create a new file named <strong>"index.html</strong> amd save it to the folder of your repository on your computer (should be in the GitHub folder under Documents).This is your main page.
            <li>On GitHub Desktop, it should automatically recognize any changes made to your folder. All you have to do from now on is to click on <strong>"Commit to main"</strong>, and after that, to publish, click on <strong?>"Publish Branch."</strong?> GitHub Pages should activate by default. </li>    
</ol>

<h3 class = 'about-site' align:center>Extra tips on GitHub</h3>
<ol class = "about-site">
        <li>Making changes on your site is easy enough. Just edit the html file created on the folder on your code editor of choice, commit to the main folder, and push to the origin via GitHub Desktop.</li>
        <li>If you're going to make multiple pages, there are two ways to do it: making a new repository (and giving it any name), or creating another HTML file. </li>
                    <li>If you choose to make a new repository for another page, repeat the process of making a site, just make sure to go to your repository's settings on GitHub, click on Pages, and select the folder of origin (should be root). Creating another HTML file is easy enough: create another file that contains the code to your alternate page, and push it to the origin. You'll need to find a way to link to it, but the easiest way to access it is through your web address (username.github.io/example). Replace example with either the name of your new repository or your html file (witt the extension).</li>
            <li>Before publishing, I suggest you run the HTML file on your computer. It will work similar as if you were to pulbish, with the perk that you can instantly you can see any changes you make every time you refresh.</li>
